# ===================
# Rust / Cargo
# ===================
target/
# Cargo.lock IS committed for this project because:
# - This produces a final binary artifact (.node file), not a Rust library
# - Not published to crates.io, so no downstream Rust consumers
# - Ensures reproducible builds and debugging capability

# ===================
# NAPI-RS Generated Files
# ===================
# These are auto-generated but committed for the package to work:
# - index.js (main entry point with loading logic)
# - native.d.ts (TypeScript definitions for native module)
# DO NOT add index.js or native.d.ts here
