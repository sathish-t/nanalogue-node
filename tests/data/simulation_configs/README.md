# Simulation Configuration Files

This directory contains JSON configuration files for generating test BAM files using `simulate_mod_bam()`.

## simple_bam.json

**Purpose**: Basic test fixture for most test cases

**Specifications**:
- **Contigs**: 2 contigs, each 10,000 bp long
- **Reads**: 1,000 reads total
  - Mapping quality: 10-20
  - Base quality: 10-20
  - Length: 50% of contig length (5,000 bp)
  - Insert sequence: "ATCG" in the middle of each read
- **Modifications**: Thymine (T) modifications
  - Base: T on plus strand
  - Modification code: T
  - Window size: 40T
  - Modification probability ranges: 10-20% and 70-80%

**Use cases**:
- Testing basic BAM reading functionality
- Validating modification extraction
- Testing filtering by sequence length, mapping quality, etc.
- Quick integration tests

## benchmark_bam.json

**Purpose**: Performance benchmarking for reproducible speed testing

- **Reads**: 1,000 reads total
  - Mapping quality: 10-20
  - Base quality: 10-20
  - Length: 1% of contig length (10,000 bp)
  - Insert sequence: "ATCG" in the middle of each read
- **Modifications**: Thymine (T) modifications
  - Base: T on plus strand
  - Modification code: T
  - Window size: 40T
  - Modification probability ranges: 10-20% and 70-80%

**Use cases**:

  - Mapping quality: 20-30
  - Base quality: 20-30
  - Length: 50% of contig length (5,000 bp)
  - Insert sequence: "ATCG" in the middle of each read
- **Modifications**: Two different modification types
  1. Thymine (T) modifications on minus strand
     - Base: T, Strand: minus
     - Modification code: T
     - Window size: 40T
     - Modification probability ranges: 10-20% and 70-80%
  2. Cytosine (C) modifications on plus strand
